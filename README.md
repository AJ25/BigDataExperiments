These are some of the projects which I always wanted to do just for fun and trying out new things.

The TODO list:
- Web Crawler: Use map reduce to simultaneously process many pages. Start off with a seed list. Use Redis to mark if the page is seen or   not so that I don't end up processing it twice. How to handle sub-domains? Need to implement some sort of rate limiting too. #Java
- DreamStack: Just some random name to try out new technologies :). 
  Currently, thinking of building a 3 node cluster with Mesos for resource management. Use dockerized apps. Try out Mesosphere(nice API    documentation) or Kubernetes(liked the service approach and pods) along with docker.
  Build a real time processing framework. Use Apache Kafka (pub-sub) to listen for events. Use Spark to do the processing.

DONE:
- Twitter feed sentiment analysis wrt stocks using Hive and Hadoop. Also, used Apache Solr to index the feed.
  Used Apache Nifi for flow management.
Will upload the code soon.
